# Changelog

All notable changes follow [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and semantic versioning.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Connected Account management with permission checks, safe disconnection, reauthorization, and permanent local deletion.
- Stable URLs for Overview, Rules, Activity, and Settings, with account identity markers throughout rule management.
- A warning before connecting a Google account when the browser address differs from the configured OAuth redirect URI, with LAN and Raspberry Pi redirect guidance.

### Changed

- Disconnected-account rules now stop clearly and preserve recovery data until reauthorization or permanent deletion.
- Appearance and color-theme preferences now share one Settings control.
- Audit entries moved from `/api/v1/activity` to `/api/v1/audit-entries`, and the old path is removed. After upgrading, reload or hard-refresh every Calendar Sync tab and bookmark: pages loaded from the previous release still call the old path, and browsers may have cached them.
- Unknown `/api/` paths now return a JSON 404 for every method, and known paths called with the wrong method return 405 with an `Allow` header, instead of the web app page.
- The web app page is now revalidated on every load, so future upgrades take effect without a hard refresh.

### Fixed

- Google OAuth callbacks now support local HTTP development, preserve PKCE verification across redirects, and recover cleanly when Calendar permissions are declined.
- Activity request failures, empty activity, and low-contrast actions now have distinct, accessible interface states.
- Activity now loads when browser content blockers such as uBlock Origin are enabled.
- The Activity page now explains why it could not load: an expired session, an updated installation that needs a reload, a service error, or a request that never reached the service, such as one stopped by a content blocker.
