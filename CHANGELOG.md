# Changelog

All notable changes follow [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and semantic versioning.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Connected Account management with permission checks, safe disconnection, reauthorization, and permanent local deletion.
- Stable URLs for Overview, Rules, Activity, and Settings, with account identity markers throughout rule management.
- A warning before connecting a Google account when the browser address differs from the configured OAuth redirect URI, with LAN and Raspberry Pi redirect guidance.
- Google profile names and photos for Connected Accounts through optional basic profile access. Reconnect existing accounts to show their photos.
- Rule Details at `/rules/{id}` showing calendars, projection policy, all-day eligibility, initial window, state, managed projection count, and the last synchronization and reconciliation outcomes.
- Transformation Policy and all-day eligibility editing as a Material Rule Change that pauses the rule, requires a new preview, and rewrites every existing projection on the next run.
- Rule Removal with an explicit choice to delete mapped projections or keep them as Detached Events, and Rule Replacement for changing a rule's calendars.
- Activity groups decisions by synchronization run, names the rule's calendars, explains every skipped, blocked, or changed event in plain language, and can be filtered by rule and outcome with older entries loaded on demand.
- Activity entries can look up their source event and Managed Projection live from Google, showing the title, time, recurrence, and a Google Calendar link without storing any event content.
- SQLite migration 3 adds stable reason codes and run identifiers to audit entries and backfills reason codes for existing entries.

### Changed

- Disconnected-account rules now stop clearly and preserve recovery data until reauthorization or permanent deletion.
- Appearance and color-theme preferences now share one Settings control.
- Rules name each Source and Destination Calendar and its account email instead of showing provider calendar identifiers.
- Migration 4 records pending reprojection and the latest run outcomes for each rule.
- Audit entries moved from `/api/v1/activity` to `/api/v1/audit-entries`, and the old path is removed. After upgrading, reload or hard-refresh every Calendar Sync tab and bookmark: pages loaded from the previous release still call the old path, and browsers may have cached them.
- Unknown `/api/` paths now return a JSON 404 for every method, known paths called with the wrong method return 405 with an `Allow` header, and known paths with an extra or missing trailing slash redirect, instead of the web app page.
- The web app page is now revalidated on every load, so future upgrades take effect without a hard refresh.

### Fixed

- Recurring events excluded by the pre-alpha policy are recorded as skipped instead of as conflicts, so they no longer appear as blocked; existing entries are shown as skipped as well.
- Google OAuth callbacks now support local HTTP development, preserve PKCE verification across redirects, and recover cleanly when Calendar permissions are declined.
- Activity request failures, empty activity, and low-contrast actions now have distinct, accessible interface states.
- Activity now loads when browser content blockers such as uBlock Origin are enabled.
- The Activity page now explains why it could not load: an expired session, an updated installation that needs a reload, a service error, or a request that never reached the service, such as one stopped by a content blocker.
