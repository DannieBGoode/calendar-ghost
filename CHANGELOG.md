All notable changes follow [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and semantic versioning.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Connected Account management with permission checks, safe disconnection, reauthorization, and permanent local deletion.
- Stable URLs for Overview, Rules, Activity, and Settings, with account identity markers throughout rule management.

### Changed

- Disconnected-account rules now stop clearly and preserve recovery data until reauthorization or permanent deletion.
- Appearance and color-theme preferences now share one Settings control.

### Fixed

- Google OAuth callbacks now support local HTTP development, preserve PKCE verification across redirects, and recover cleanly when Calendar permissions are declined.
- Activity request failures, empty activity, and low-contrast actions now have distinct, accessible interface states.
- Activity now loads when browser content blockers such as uBlock Origin are enabled; audit entries are served from `/api/v1/audit-entries` instead of `/api/v1/activity`.
